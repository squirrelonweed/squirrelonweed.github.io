## About SquirrelOnWeed

Welcome to the SquirrelOnWeed Wiki. This site will be used to share my own knowledge from homelabbing as well as other things that interest me. I have over 5 years of experience in homelabbing, and I am always looking for new tools and resources. My focus is on low power, high performance computing. I got a lot of inspiration from [ServeTheHome's TinyMiniMicro](https://www.servethehome.com/introducing-project-tinyminimicro-home-lab-revolution/) project along with other great content creators such as TechnoTim, Christian Lempa, LearnLinuxTV, and others. I hope you enjoy the content here.

Feel free to contribute / write posts from the [GitHub](https://github.com/squirrelonweed/squirrelonweed.github.io). I will do my best to keep all articles up to date but I am relying on the community to help me. Please and thank you!
